A simple website explaining a number of variables relating to the mass incarceration in the US

Question 1: Time  Trend Chart
This chart focuses on the variable black_prison_pop and takes into consideration only the Alabama (AL) State. The trend in the chart shows a steady increase in the number of incarcerated black people over the years. There is a large difference between the number of black people incarcerate between 1990-200 and between 2000-2010. 

This chart was included to illustrate the effect that the incarceration has on the black population as more people are imprisoned. It was also important in demonstrating that incarceration in the US has worsened as compared to previous years. 

Question 2: Variable Comparison Chart
This chart takes into consideration three variables; black_prison_pop, white_prison_pop and total_prison_adm_rate. The chart shows the trend in the relationship between the rate of prison admission and total prison population on the black and white people. The rate of prison admission is observed to steadily increase with time leading to an increase in both the numbers of black and white prisoners in the facilities. The other trend that come out is that the total prison population of black people is more than that of white people as the rate of prison admission gets higher.

The chart was added to the document to illustrate the relationship between different variables over a given duration of time. In this case, the white and black prison population was compared.


Question 3: Geographic Distribution Map
This map was added to illustrate visually the number of incarcerated individuals in the US. Many of the states are observed to have incarcerated more 20,000 individuals in the period between year 2005 and year 2015. This shows that in a span of an year, many of the states incarcerate over 2000 individuals which is fairly a large number.
